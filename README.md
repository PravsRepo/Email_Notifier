LEAP Program Tracker

Purpose- To track each and every session of LEAP programs by the LEAP team efficiently. 

The users of this system are the LEAP team and the LEAP college coordinator.

Before every session, an E-mail notification will be sent to the LEAP team and to the LEAP college coordinator, if needed.
And after the session too.

A login account would be created for the LEAP team. Username and Password would be shared. Other than the LEAP team, 
no one is supposed to utilize this account. 

After login, a separate environment will be created for each college. Each college has a schedule of LEAP programs, and an E-mail notification will send by the 
LEAP team champion(Sender) who is responsible for a particular college.
